## Overview

FLiPPR (**F**ragPipe **Li**mited-**P**roteolysis **Pr**ocessor) is modular, fast, and easy-to-use data processing tool for LiP-MS experiments analyzed in FragPipe.

FLiPPR is:
* **Super Fast**: FLiPPR utilizes [Polars](https://pola.rs/) in the back-end to ensure all CPU cores contribute to your data processing.
* **Convinent to Use**: [FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/) produces standarized outputs, FLiPPR takes full advantage of this feat and integrates seemlessly with any FragPipe LFQ DDA or DIA anaylsis.
* **Flexible and Expandable**: Experiments introduce unique and novel variables, FLiPPR ensures compatibility with all experimental setups and gives you full control of the data processing pipeline.

## Support
FLiPPR requires python â‰¥3.10
To learn more about how FLiPPR can help you analyze your LiP-MS or LFQ data, head over to the [FLiPPR docs](https://flippr.readthedocs.io)

## Installation

```bash
    # Initial install
    python -m pip install flippr

    # Update to latest release
    python -m pip install -U flippr
```

## Usage

1. Start a `Study`

```python
import flippr

study = flippr.Study(lip = "path/to/fragpipe_output", method="dda")

```

2. View the experimental sample annotations

```python
print(study.samples)
# >>> { 'LiP': {'WT', '1x_Drug', '5x_Drug'}

```

3. Add an experimental process

```python
study.add_process(pid="1x", ctrl="WT", test="1x_Drug", n_rep=3)

study.add_process(pid="5x", ctrl="WT", test="5x_Drug", n_rep=3)

```

4. Run your study

```python
results = study.run()

results
# >>> {'1x': <flippr.Results>, '5x': <flippr.Results>}
```

5. View or save your results as Polars DataFrames

```python
results["1x"].ion

# View higher-order results
results["1x"].modified_peptide
results["1x"].peptide
results["1x"].cut_site

# View protein-level summary of all data
results["1x"].protein_summary

```
